        <p>
            My name is Brian Thornburg (he/him). I am 29 years old and live in Cedar Rapids Iowa. I am married and have a two year old son named Milo.
            I went to the University of Northern Iowa for studio art specializing in painting.
            My work experience has mostly been within the restaurant industry and I still currently work as a line cook at Big Grove Brewpub.
            I essentially have zero work experience in the field of tech and programming.
            My main goal is to become efficient enough at programming in order to start my career as a programmer.
            I also wish to always be striving to learn more about programming as it is a large field that appears to always be changing and improving.
